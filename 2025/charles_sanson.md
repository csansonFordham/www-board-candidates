I am Charles Sanson.  Welcome to my candidacy page for the OWASP Global Board of Directors.
<br>

#### What open source contributions, research or visible leadership work have you done? If few, what 3 specific outcomes will you deliver in your first 90 days on the board in OWASP and how will members verify the progress?
<br>
<br>
I am a seasoned IT professional who has been leading IT developer teams for the past 20 years.
I have managed many high profile development initiatives where I had to define the SSDLC, enforce the secure code development practices leveraging the OWASP top ten, rally the teams and ensure the end product met or surpassed peer code review and Application Security scans.

In my first ninety days, I would prioritize the expansion of OWASP resources and projects on security issues in the area of Artificial Intelligence.
As current co-chair of the AJCU AI Special Interest Group, we, in Higher Ed, see that this new area has such a broad potential to expose users and data to breaches in ways that had never been expected before 2023. 
This new threat vector is also an opportunity for OWASP to show its importance to the community by rising to the challengess presented by this new vertical.
This is also an excellent way for us to recruit participants and funding from corporations that rely on our work to enhance their foundational security.

In essence, I would increase Member Engagement and Community Participation by developing a new pilot program, the "Developer-to-OWASP Bridge," focused on onboarding seasoned IT professionals into community leadership roles. This would include creating a clear, 90-day onboarding guide for new project leads, chapter officers, and committee members.

Second, I believe OWASP must be at the forefront of securing the next generation of applications, and that means focusing on Artificial Intelligence. I would use my leadership experience to drive new projects that address security risks in AI and machine learning systems, expanding on the GenAI Security Project.

Lastly, as board members are the financial stewards of this foundation, I would recommend that we implement a new, transparent financial reporting system. This would involve working with the Treasurer to create and publish a simple, easy-to-understand "OWASP Financial Snapshot" on a quarterly basis. This report would summarize the foundation's income, expenses, and budget against actuals, presented in a clear, public format for the community.
